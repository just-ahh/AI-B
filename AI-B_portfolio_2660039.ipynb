This journal discusses all the events that took place on this trip, including all the people they met and the weather when staying. Often it acts like a diary with activities for each day described inside alongside the author's opinions on different people places and events. The journal is also partly illustrated with pen and ink drawings in between the descriptions. The drawings depict what was occurring is the scene above it and is used to give a visualisation of the events previously described. These drawings feature throughout the journal but more so towards the beginning. The theory being the author got tired of having to do all the illustrations and therefore focused more on the writing aspect. Furthermore, the drawings are all in black ink on paper except one drawing near the end which is drawn in full colour. Believed to be for the purpose of highlighting the outfit the girl is wearing in the drawing.</p>"

Using more images also helps to break through any literacy barriers and also allow people who speak other languages to have more of an understanding of what the journal describes.

    "<p> Another issue to consider when looking at copyright and the use of generative AI is the owner of the new images just created. In this case of using a work that is most likely in the public domain, the new image rights holder is messy to navigate. If the new images are based off an existing work, then would the original creator of the work/images the AI generation ones are based on retain copyright for replicating the style of the work? Or if the original creator has passed away, would the copyright holder own the images instead? Another way it could be split is the person collaborating and utilising the AI, would their prompt engineering and skilful use of the generative AI grant them copyright ownership. Or could the rights fall to the AI itself or the company that hosts it, an example being ChatGPT being hosted and run by OpenAI. Furthermore, can an AI be capable of owning copyright and other similar legal rights as it is often a neural network. Finally, the other option to consider is putting the AI generated images that are replicating the original straight into the public domain so no one can gain ownership. All of these options are important to consider when looking at the applications of this project in a broader context of human and AI creative collaboration.\n",

Currently at the capabilities that AI is at, this is extremely had to do, even when giving the AI a reference image and prompt engineering to get as close as possible. This could be down to numerous factors such as my own skills in utilising an AI, the system being used of Microsoft Copilot with DALL.E model 3 or the current technical limitations of generative AI. In a few years, generation of pieces in a lesser-known artwork’s style could be possible.
