# AI-B - Portfolio

There is a requirements.txt file present in the repository but it is blank due to the notebook not having any code inside of it. The portfolio makes use of external AI tools. The requirements file is added just for proof of no internal code.

Many thanks to my peer support group for their input in this project and to the staff for all of their help!
